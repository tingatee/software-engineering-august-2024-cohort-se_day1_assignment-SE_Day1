#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to; write instructions for computers build apps, games, and websites that make our lives easier.
software engineering is crucial because it provides the methodologies, frameworks, and tools needed to create software that meets user needs, performs well, as well as Solving real-world problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i.	The Software Crisis (1960s-1970s): This period was marked by large, complex software projects that often failed due to poor quality, cost overruns, and missed deadlines. This crisis led to the emergence of structured programming and software engineering principles to address these issues.
ii.	Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s): OOP revolutionized software development by introducing the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behaviour. This paradigm led to more modular, reusable, and maintainable software.
iii.	Agile Methodologies (2000s): Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, gained popularity as a response to the limitations of traditional waterfall development. They emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

i.	Planning: The initial phase of the SDLC, involves defining the software's purpose and scope, establishing a timeline, and determining a budget. 
ii.	Requirement analysis: seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. Identify problems users face and come up with a plan to address them. 
iii.	Design: Software architecture and system design are planned. This phase defines how the system will be structured and specifies the technical specifications. 
iv.	Coding: Developers write the actual code based on the design. This phase involves creating the software components and translating design into executable programs. 
v.	Testing: The software is tested for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. This phase ensures the software meets the requirements runs smoothly. 
vi.	Deployment: involves rolling out the tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users either in stages or all at once depending on the strategy. 
vii.	Maintenance: After deployment, software may need updates, bug fixes, or new features to address issues or changing user needs. This phase ensures the long-term viability of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It's suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes.
Example: Developing software for a government regulatory body with fixed requirements that are unlikely to change once defined.
Agile: An iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and continuous delivery. It's ideal for projects with evolving requirements and uncertain outcomes.
Example: Building a consumer-facing mobile app where user feedback may drive changes and frequent updates are needed

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

i.	Software Developer: Writes, tests, and debugs code.
ii.	Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software for defects and ensures quality standards.
iii.	Project Manager: Oversees the entire software development process, manages resources, and ensures project timelines and budgets are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i.	Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): provide developers with tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers. This makes it easier to write, test, and debug code. Example include Visual Studio Code
ii.	Version Control Systems (VCS): Allow developers to track changes in their code, collaborate on code with others, and manage different versions of the software. Example include GitHub and GitLab.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i.	Debugging Complex Code: Finding and fixing bugs in large, complex systems can be time-consuming. Strategy: Use unit tests, automated testing, and code reviews to catch issues early.
ii.	Dealing with Evolving Requirements: Changes in project scope or requirements can disrupt development. Strategy: Agile methodologies can help manage and incorporate changing requirements in an iterative manner.
iii.	Maintaining Code Quality: As software projects grow, maintaining clean and manageable code becomes harder. Strategy: Enforce coding standards, use code linters, and conduct regular code reviews.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i.	Unit Testing: Testing individual units of code.
ii.	Integration Testing: Testing how different components interact.
iii.	System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
iv.	Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of giving instructions to AI models in order to get the desired output. It involves understanding how AI interprets input and crafting prompts that are clear, specific, and concise.

Importance: Prompt engineering is crucial because it influences the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of the AI's output. Well-designed prompts can improve AI's performance, making it a valuable tool for various applications, from customer service to content generation

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
“Write me a cover letter for an accountant position”
“*Attaches resume* Use the above information to write me a cover letter for an accountant position with the following job description *attaches JD* Make it sort and precise and avoid buzz words”
